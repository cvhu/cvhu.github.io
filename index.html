        <p> Hi, my name is Vic, and I've been building software for a decade.</p>
        <p> Over ten years ago, I started my career as the technical co-founder of a startup called Dediced, where I tackled all the technical challenges of building a personalized bookmark recommendation engine.</p>
        <p> In my most recent role in Reality Labs at Meta, I built the backend system that supports object recognition and recall on an AR platform before I took my parental leave and got impacted by <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2022/11/mark-zuckerberg-layoff-message-to-employees/">the layoff.</a></p>
        <p> Before that, I spent almost 6 years at Indeed under the search, targeted ads, and profile resume space, where I grew a team from zero to 4 engineers and launched the resume delivery platform across 4 different teams.</p>
        <p> Between Meta and Indeed, I spent 2 years at Panopto leading its meeting recording integration features for <a href="https://www.panopto.com/features/integration/webex/">Cisco Webex</a> and <a href="https://www.panopto.com/features/integration/teams/#:~:text=Panopto%E2%80%99s%20Team%20integration%20allows%20institutions%20to%20use%20Panopto,integrated%20with%20Microsoft%20365%20applications%20via%20Microsoft%20Graph.">Microsoft Teams</a>.</p>
        <P> If you'd like to chat, send me a message on LinkedIn.</P>
